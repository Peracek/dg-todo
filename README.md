# TODO list app

Welcome! This a simple TODO list app created as a test tasks to show my coding skills.

## Requirements

### Design

- Esthetically pleasing and easy-to-use UI
- Desktop-first design

### Task list

- Show list of tasks per authenticated user
- Task has a name and description
- Form for creating and editing tasks

### Persistence

- Store tasks in database

### Error handling

- Make sure user is informed about possible errors

## Extra: Offline mode

To make the task a bit more challenging and educating I've implemented an offline mode allowing user to work with tasks when out of network connection. When the user gets back online the pending changes are synched with database.

Here's a demo how it looks like.
